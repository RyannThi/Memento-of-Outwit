# Memento-of-Outwit
"Source code" for my BHA3 entry, 東方乳牛時　～ Memento of Outwit

THE SOURCE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AS OF VERSION v1.01a ON ITCH.IO: https://ryann1908.itch.io/memento-of-outwit

This repository does not include changes in THlib that allow for some things to work as expected (see: main menu automatically booting, restarting stages, etc).
It also does not currently include the backgrounds used in the game, or the players. (I may add them later)

**Some resource usages I'd like to mention**:
